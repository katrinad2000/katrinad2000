        <h3 style="color:#233c86"> Commodification of Art</h3>
        <p style="color:#101F4C"> I found it interesting how Berger explained that the camera
        has changed how we see art. Paintings seen wtih the human eye can now be reproduced with the camera, making it
    available to be seen anywhere. In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Walter Benjamin describes how this
<span>commodification</span> can lead to an element losing its aura or special quality. In a way, I think this could be a good thing, as 
it allows for art to be more accessible, rather than only being available for viewing by the elite. For example, anyone can view
the Mona Lisa whether they have the means to travel to the Louvre or not. </p>

        <h3 style="color:#233c86">Promises of a False Dream</h3>
        <p style="color:#101F4C"> Out of all the episodes of Ways of Seeing I watched, I found the fourth episode the most interesting. We interact with advertisements so much in our daily lives and they can have an effect on us without us even really noticing.</p>
        <img src="status.png"
        <p style="color:#101F4C">This idea really stood out to me. Advertisements always seek to illustrate a life they believe their
        audience wants to live. Often times, what they advertise is not actually achievable through purchasing their product. This life "status" they try
    to promote is truly inaccessible to the vast majority of consumers, however, they propose that buying their product will improve our lives but it 
can often make them worse. For example, smoking advertisements targeting men would often include images of women, and of course, they don't actually come with the cigarettes.
They promote this lifestyle, but actually buying the cigarettes has a negative impact on your health.</p>

<p style="color:#101F4C">This quote also stood out to me as Berger brings up how publicity plays to appeal to a life we aspire to have. 
Advertisements try to trick us into believing that we can change our lives if we buy more of their products, as if we can get richer, when in reality we are getting poorer by doing so.
Publicity appeals to the working class, telling them to buy the hottest products even if they aren't a necessity and unaffordable. They use
public figures and events as examples of people who have been transferred succesfully into a more dream-life like in an attempt to persuade us.</p>

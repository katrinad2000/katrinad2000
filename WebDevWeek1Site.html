        <h3 style="color:#233c86"> Commodification of Art</h3>
        <p style="color:#101F4C"> I found it interesting how Berger explained that the camera
        has changed how we see art. Paintings seen wtih the human eye can now be reproduced with the camera, making it
    available to be seen anywhere. In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Walter Benjamin describes how this
<span>commodification</span> can lead to an element losing its aura or special quality. In a way, I think this could be a good thing, as 
it allows for art to be more accessible, rather than only being available for viewing by the elite. For example, anyone can view
the Mona Lisa whether they have the means to travel to the Louvre or not. </p>

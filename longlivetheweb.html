        <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple">I really found the whole conversation regarding free speech on the Internet really interesting. It was stated that 
    "The Web should be like a white sheet of paper: ready to be written on, with no control over what is written." As Tim Berners-Lee explains,
    this isn't the case. A lot of countries place restrictions on what their citizens can access online. When the U.S. Senate's Combating
    Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act was brought up, I was reminded of what is going on now with Trump and TikTok. As Berners-Lee mentions, 
    "no due process of law protects people before they are disconnected or their sites are blocked." From what I read about Trump's threats to ban
    TikTok, he planned to initiate an executive order to ban any access to the recently popular app mainly because it was owned by China. I am a bit
    curious about the differences in fearing other countries accessing our data, when American owned companies like Facebook do the same.

    <h3 style="color:rebeccapurple"> I also found the short blurb about the future web in action really engaging. I recently checked out the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, and it 
        is interesting how technology companies on social machines use data to create advertisements to influence people to buy products. Also, looking 
    to the future to making the Internet more accessible, for those with disabilities and in devoloping countries is very important. I feel like especially in times 
    like now where literally everything from school to work is virtual, making the Internet more accesible is a necessity. </h3>
